# Awesome Agentic AI

## What is Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit autonomous behavior, goal-directed actions, and decision-making capabilities. Unlike passive or reactive AI, which responds to specific inputs or commands, agentic AI acts proactively, making independent choices to achieve predefined objectives. This type of AI can learn from its environment, adapt to new information, and execute tasks without continuous human oversight. It embodies characteristics like self-motivation, self-improvement, and strategic planning, aiming to perform complex tasks efficiently and effectively by mimicking human-like agency and intelligence.
